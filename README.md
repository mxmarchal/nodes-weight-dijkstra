# nodes-weight-dijkstra

## About

nodes-weight-dijkstra is a prototype application developed using Bun, Vite, and React. It visualizes the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. Designed as a practical demonstration of pathfinding in graph theory, this project showcases an interactive SVG canvas for exploring graph-based algorithms.

## Features

- **Interactive SVG Graph**: Displays nodes and edges on an SVG canvas for a clear and engaging visual representation of a graph.
- **Pathfinding with Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph.
- **Node Selection**: Users can select two nodes interactively to visualize the shortest path between them.
- **Prototype Design**: Developed as a prototype for demonstration and educational purposes, not intended for production use.
